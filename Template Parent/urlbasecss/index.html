    <img src="images.jpeg" alt="">
    <ul>
        <li>Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players. (Sometime in junior competitions you will find 8 player teams).</li>
        <li>Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling.</li>
        <li>The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat.</li>
        <li>The fielding team must get 10 batsmen out before they can change over and start batting.</li>
        <li>The aim of the game is to score as many runs as possible before the fielding team takes 10 wickets. The team with the most runs wins.</li>
